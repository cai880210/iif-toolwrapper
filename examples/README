Tool specification examples.

All example's are pretty straight forward, however there are three special cases:

- exiftool (outputstream)

In the exiftool example the following is defined:
  <output name="outputstream">

Giving the output the name 'outputstream' makes it possible to capture the output 
(from stdout, stderr) of a tool and redirect it to an output file.

- unzip (outputdir)

In the unzip example the following is defined:
  <output name="outputdir">

Giving the output name 'outputdir' assumes the tool does not produce a file as output,
but instead it returns a directory as output of the operation.

- ocropus (inputdir)

In the ocropus example the following is defined:
  <input name="inputdir">

Defining an inputname as 'inputdir' will result in mirroring the remote directory via http,
and then feeding it to the current tool as input.

The output filename is determined by the input file name, for example if the input file name
for a workflow is "example_image.tif", given that the workflow creates xml, the ouput file name
will be as followed: "example_image.xml". To override this feature, use the <OutFileName> option 
in the output section as seen in example wordevaluation.xml.
